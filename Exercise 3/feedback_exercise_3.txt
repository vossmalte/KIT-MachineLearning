Feedback Exercise 3:

Task 1: 5.0 / 6.0 points.
Some calculation mistakes in solving dual, otherwise good
What if your computed lambda* < 0? This would not be allowed. In that case lambda* = 0 and you get the global optimum as the solution. We didnâ€˜t deduct points for that though. To check out an example, have a look at this graph: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kvayjkpjbf The dark side is the area where the solution is allowed.
